We are looking at voter behavior for the 2024 presidential election between Biden and Trump . Using a survey from March of 2024, we will attempt to determine what proportion of all votes will be cast for Joe Biden in the 2024 election.


```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)

poll_data <- tibble(biden = as.factor(c(rep("Yes", 655), 
                                        rep("No", 904)))) |> 
                slice_sample(prop = 1)

```
